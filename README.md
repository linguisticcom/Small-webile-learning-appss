# Small Webile Learning Apps – Linguistic Communication

This repository contains the source code and HTML games used in the **Linguistic Communication Webapps Portal**, a suite of interactive learning tools developed for IT, business, and Agile training.

All games are deployed in a shared `public_html/` directory, with a master `index.html` file that serves as a responsive portal interface for launching them.

## 🌐 Project Purpose

The **Small Webile Learning Apps** project supports experiential learning through short, focused, web-based games and simulations. Each app is mapped to a training module (LAN 10, LAN 30, LAN 50, etc.) and helps students reinforce key concepts in IT support, security, business systems, Agile roles, and communication.
